# DeltaMod-Blender-Tools
A collection of UI Panel tools that I hope to continuously update that performs different tasks that are not included in the core of blender.

The addon is found in the side panel in the 3d view, in "View 3D > Sidebar > DMBT"

# Select By Weight 
Choose a range of weights within a group that you want to select, from minimum to maximum, and it will select them for you. For instance, if you want to select all vertices that have weight zero, you can set min=0, max=0 and only those vertices will be selected.
